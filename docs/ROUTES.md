## 7. User-Facing Product Status Labels

Product list/detail routes should use these labels:

- active: 판매중
- sold_out + available inventory remains: 구매마감 · 보유권 사용 가능
- sold_out + no available inventory: 품절
- hidden: not shown on user-facing routes

sold_out blocks new purchases. Draw play remains allowed only when available inventory remains and the user has an unused matching credit.
